# Zone Markup Language (ZML)

ZML is an XML-based markup language designed for the specification of physical property, in conjunction with the Zone Protocol.

Every piece of property contained within the Zone Protocol is represented as an NFT (non-fungible token), which is linked to an associated deed file. Deed files are specified in ZML.
